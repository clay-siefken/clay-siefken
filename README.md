@clay-siefken reporting in, here.
- I'm a software developer, currently full-time, full-stack. I'm working on some really cool stuff at Nelnet.
- I’m interested in watching our for best practices in technical and soft skills, and bring those home to my team.
- I’m currently learning DevOps-y things like AWS automation, Kubernetes, Docker services, GitHub Actions.
- I’m not particularly active in the open source community, but if you think I might be useful to you, please let me know.
- Hit me up at clay@siefken.us
